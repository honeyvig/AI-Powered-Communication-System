# AI-Powered-Communication-System
AI-driven communication system that can:

Understand and respond to customer inquiries.
Access websites to find events and available reservations.
Book reservations and send confirmation links to customers.
Communicate via SMS, email, or messaging apps.
Integrate with CRM systems to track interactions.
--------
To build an AI-driven communication system that can handle customer inquiries, access websites to find events and available reservations, make bookings, and send confirmation links to customers, we will need to combine several technologies:

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding and responding to customer inquiries.
    Web scraping to access event listings and available reservations on websites.
    Email/SMS integration for sending booking confirmations and interacting with customers.
    CRM system integration for tracking interactions.

This platform involves multiple components, so let's break it down into separate tasks:

    Understand Customer Inquiries: Use NLP models to understand the intent of customer inquiries (e.g., looking for events, making reservations).
    Find Events and Available Reservations: Use web scraping to fetch data from event websites (or APIs, if available).
    Book Reservations: Use API calls to book reservations and send confirmation.
    Send Communication (SMS, Email, Messaging): Integrate with services like Twilio (SMS) and SMTP (email).
    Integrate with CRM Systems: Use a system like Salesforce, HubSpot, or a simple database to track interactions.

Here's an example implementation combining the necessary components:
Install Dependencies

To start, you'll need several Python libraries:

pip install spacy requests twilio smtplib Flask beautifulsoup4 pandas

Step-by-Step Code

import spacy

# Load NLP model for understanding customer inquiries
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

# Example Flask app for handling customer inquiries
app = Flask(__name__)

# Sample CRM system (using a simple dictionary to store interactions)

# Email credentials for sending confirmation emails
email_sender = 'your_email@example.com'
email_password = 'your_email_password'
smtp_server = 'smtp.example.com'
smtp_port = 587

def send_sms(phone_number, message):
    """Send SMS via Twilio"""
    client = Client(twilio_sid, twilio_auth_token)

        server.quit()
        print("Email sent successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Failed to send email: {e}")

        event_time = event_div.find("span", class_="time").text
        events.append({
            "name": event_name,
            "date": event_date,
            "time": event_time
        })
    
    return events

def make_reservation(event_name, customer_details):
    """Simulate making a reservation for an event"""
    # In a real-world scenario, here you would make an API call or use a form to book
    # For now, just simulate the reservation success.
    reservation_id = f"RES-{customer_details['name'][:3]}-{event_name[:3]}-001"
    return reservation_id

def process_inquiry(inquiry_text):

    if "event" in inquiry_text.lower() or "reservation" in inquiry_text.lower():
        intent = 'reservation_inquiry'
    elif "book" in inquiry_text.lower() or "reserve" in inquiry_text.lower():

    elif intent == 'booking_request':
        return "Please provide the event name and your details to proceed with the booking."
    
    else:
        return "I'm sorry, I didn't quite understand that. Can you please clarify?"

@app.route('/inquire', methods=['POST'])
def inquire():
    """Handle customer inquiry requests"""
    customer_inquiry = request.json.get('inquiry')
    customer_phone = request.json.get('phone')
    customer_email = request.json.get('email')

    # Process the inquiry
    response = process_inquiry(customer_inquiry)
    
    # Store the inquiry in CRM system (simple dictionary)
    crm[customer_phone] = crm.get(customer_phone, []) + [customer_inquiry]
    
    # If it's a booking request, make a reservation (simulating)
    if "Please provide the event name" in response:

        reservation_id = make_reservation("Sample Event", {"name": customer_phone})
        confirmation_message = f"Your reservation ID is {reservation_id}. Thank you for booking!"
        send_sms(customer_phone, confirmation_message)  # Send SMS confirmation
        send_email(customer_email, "Reservation Confirmation", confirmation_message)  # Send email confirmation
        response += f"\nYour booking is confirmed with ID: {reservation_id}"
    
    return jsonify({"response": response})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Explanation of Key Components:

    Natural Language Processing (NLP):
        The process_inquiry function uses spaCy to analyze the customer inquiry. Depending on the content of the inquiry, it determines whether the customer is asking about events, booking requests, or other matters.

    Web Scraping for Events:
        web_scraping_for_events simulates the web scraping process to gather event data. In this case, the data is simulated by scraping a fictional website for events.

    Booking Reservations:
        The make_reservation function simulates making a reservation for an event. In practice, you'd replace this with an actual API call to a reservation service.

    Communication via SMS and Email:
        The send_sms function uses the Twilio API to send SMS messages.
        The send_email function uses SMTP to send confirmation emails.

    CRM Integration:
        We store customer interactions in a basic CRM system (simulated by a Python dictionary) that associates phone numbers with inquiries.

    Flask API:
        The Flask API exposes an endpoint (/inquire) where customers can send JSON-formatted requests (with their inquiry, phone number, and email). The server processes the inquiry, interacts with external systems, and sends SMS and email confirmations.

How to Use the System:

    Start the Flask Server: Run the Flask server locally with python app.py to start listening for requests.

    Send Inquiry via POST Request: You can use Postman or any HTTP client to send a POST request to /inquire with the following body:

{
  "inquiry": "I'd like to book a reservation for an event",
  "phone": "+1234567890",
  "email": "customer@example.com"
}

    Response: The system will process the inquiry, generate a response, make a reservation (simulated), and send an SMS and email confirmation.

Final Notes:

    Web Scraping: This can be expanded to scrape real event websites or access APIs to get up-to-date information.
    CRM Integration: If you use a CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot, you could use their APIs to store and track interactions.
    Messaging Apps: You could also integrate with services like Facebook Messenger, Slack, or WhatsApp using APIs from those platforms.

This is a foundational setup for an AI-driven communication system and can be expanded with more advanced AI models and integration with live systems.
